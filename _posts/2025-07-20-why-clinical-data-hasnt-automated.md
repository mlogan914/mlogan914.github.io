Clinical data standards like CDISC ODM give us everything we need to automate SDTM transformations â€” but the industry hasnâ€™t taken full advantage. This post explores why, and how we can finally bridge that gap.

<!--more-->

For over two decades, CDISC has provided us with deeply thoughtful metadata standards. The Operational Data Model (ODM) wasnâ€™t just created to document what we did â€” it was designed to enable automation, consistency, and reuse. It gave us a structured, machine-readable way to describe the forms, fields, controlled terminology, and relationships that make up a clinical trial.

And yet, here we are: still copying SDTM specs into Excel, writing thousands of lines of SAS code by hand, and maintaining hardcoded mappings across studies that look nearly identical.

Itâ€™s not because weâ€™re lazy. Itâ€™s because the people doing the work are under-resourced, overburdened, and deeply siloed â€” and the systems that support them were never designed for modern workflows.

But now, there is opportunity to change that.

## The ODM: More Than Metadata â€” Itâ€™s Infrastructure

Letâ€™s start with the basics.

The CDISC Operational Data Model (ODM-XML) is a standardized format for representing:

- Study design.  
- Case report forms.  
- Item definitions (with datatypes, labels, units, etc.).  
- Codelists and value-level metadata.  
- Audit trails, versioning, and relationships.  

Itâ€™s verbose, yes, but itâ€™s also deeply rich â€” and if we treat it as the source of truth, it can do more than describe a study. It can become the foundation for:

- Automated SDTM scaffolding.  
- Study-agnostic data transformations.  
- Real-time metadata traceability.  
- Spec-to-code pipelines with overrides.  
- AI-assisted mapping and validation.  

ODM often goes underutilized â€” not because it lacks depth, but because weâ€™ve never been encouraged to treat it as a functional tool.

##  Example: Whatâ€™s Actually in an ODM File?
Hereâ€™s a simplified snippet of what you might find in a real-world ODM file:

```xml
<ItemDef OID="IT.QS.QSSTRESC" Name="Severity" DataType="text">
  <Question>Severity of Pain</Question>
  <CodeListRef CodeListOID="CL.SEVERITY_SCALE"/>
</ItemDef>

<CodeList OID="CL.SEVERITY_SCALE" Name="Severity Scale">
  <CodeListItem CodedValue="MILD"><Decode><TranslatedText>Mild</TranslatedText></Decode></CodeListItem>
  <CodeListItem CodedValue="MOD"><Decode><TranslatedText>Moderate</TranslatedText></Decode></CodeListItem>
  <CodeListItem CodedValue="SEV"><Decode><TranslatedText>Severe</TranslatedText></Decode></CodeListItem>
</CodeList>
```
From just this, a system could:
- Infer the appropriate STRESC and STRESN logic
- Scaffold the QS domainâ€™s QSSTRESC variable with appropriate mapping
- Validate data values against the codelist

Instead of using this directly, we often retype this same information into a spec spreadsheetâ€¦ and then again into SAS code.

## Why Havenâ€™t We Used the Specs CDISC Gave Us?

This is the real question, and it deserves reflection.

Here are a few reasons Iâ€™ve observed:

### 1. EDC Vendors Own the Output
Most sponsors donâ€™t generate ODM â€” they receive it from EDC platforms like Medidata or Oracle. That means:
- The structure is often proprietary or inconsistent
- Thereâ€™s little transparency into how the ODM is generated
- Thereâ€™s no incentive (yet) to clean or standardize it

### 2. Specs Are Still Handwritten
Even with ODM in place, many orgs still create and pass around Excel/Word-based specs for SDTM mapping. Why?
- It feels familiar
- Programmers are used to SAS, not metadata parsing
- Clinical teams often work in silos from engineers

### 3. ODM Is Treated as an Archive, Not a Tool
The industry sees ODM as a recordkeeping format â€” something to store, not something to build with. But it was always meant to be both.

## What If We Used ODM as Intended?
<script src="https://gist.github.com/mlogan914/b73fa337f982f697fa4f55e58279fd72.js"></script>

By parsing ODM and pairing it with a reference model (e.g., SDTMIG or CDISC Library), we can:
- Automatically match ItemOIDs to SDTM targets
- Generate compliant scaffolding for standard domains
- Allow for lightweight custom overrides where needed

## What Iâ€™m Building

Iâ€™ve been working on a Blueprint-as-a-Service (BaaS) framework that:
- Parses ODM-JSON or ODM-XML
- Matches metadata to SDTM targets
- Generates scaffolding SQL using DBT
- Supports overrides for custom derivations
- Outputs traceable, auditable pipeline templates

My goal is to make SDTM programming modular, inspectable, and automatable â€” while still honoring the deep expertise of clinical teams and the nuances of individual studies.

Iâ€™ll be sharing more about the project soon. But for now, I want to invite others to reflect with me:

> This isnâ€™t about replacing people. Itâ€™s about respecting their time and expertise enough to remove the busywork and empower smarter workflows.

We donâ€™t need to wait for vendors to catch up.
We can start small. Build modularly. Use the standards we already have.

If weâ€™re thoughtful, we can finally bridge the gap between whatâ€™s possible and whatâ€™s actually happening.

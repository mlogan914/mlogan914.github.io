<div class="notice--info">
    Many organizations focus on fixing individual data issues but overlook the bigger picture: how data enters, moves, and is governed across the entire environment. This article shows a practical before-and-after example of moving from fragmented data flows to governed, versioned pipeline — an approach that supports scalability, trust, and repeatability without relying on tool-first thinking.

In my previous article, [Data Platform Engineering for Regulated Teams](/data%20&%20platform%20engineering/data-platform-engineering-for-regulated-data-teams/), I explained why modernizing data in regulated industries requires more than simply swapping out tools.  

This follow-up shows what that shift can look like in practice — moving from fragmented, ad-hoc flows to a governed, repeatable data pipeline.  

If you’re unsure what a “data pipeline” is, see my definition here: [What is Data Engineering?](https://mlogan914.github.io/data%20&%20platform%20engineering/what-is-data-platform-engineering/#data-engineering)  

> **Note:** If you are unfamiliar with any terms or acronyms in this article or its diagrams, refer to the [summary of acronyms](#summary-of-acronyms) at the end of the article.

## Two Layers of Modernization

Modernizing data involves two connected layers:  

1. **Data Engineering** – Designing and building standardized, governed pipelines that handle ingestion, transformation, and controlled outputs.  
2. **Platform Engineering** – The delivery model for those pipelines: modular workflows, reusable components, automation, and tooling that reduce the burden on engineers and programmers.  

> This article focuses on the **first layer** — data engineering — and illustrates what modernized pipelines can look like. The *how* of building and running them (platform engineering) is equally important and will be covered in a future article.

## The Core Idea

Many organizations have data flowing in from multiple systems and vendors, each using their own methods to send it over. Without consistent entry points, quality checks, or structure, the result is hard to scale, hard to trust, and expensive to maintain.

A modern engineering approach changes that by:
- Defining **one “front door”** for all incoming data.
- Running **quality checks early**.
- Using **layered storage** to clearly separate raw, refined, and curated data.
- Governing **how definitions and rules are applied** so they’re consistent everywhere.

## Example: Current vs. Future State

Here’s a fictional example to make it concrete.

---

### Current State: Fragmented and Inconsistent

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  %% Sources
  subgraph SRC[Sources]
    CRM[(CRM System)]
    EHR[(Clinical App)]
    LIMS[(Lab System)]
    Sheets[(Spreadsheets – uncontrolled)]
  end

  %% Ingestion & Landing
  subgraph ING[Ingestion & Landing]
    SFTP[(SFTP Drop)]
    API[[API Pull]]
    NAS[(Shared Drive – uncontrolled)]:::problem
    Intake[(Cloud Landing Area)]
  end

  %% Processing
  subgraph PROC[Processing]
    Legacy[[Legacy Jobs]]:::problem
    Scripts[[Ad-hoc Scripts]]:::problem
  end

  %% Storage
  subgraph STORE[Storage]
    OnDW[(On-Prem DW)]:::problem
    Cloud[(Cloud DW)]
  end

  %% Flows
  CRM --> SFTP --> Intake
  EHR --> API --> Intake
  LIMS --> SFTP --> NAS
  Sheets -. ad-hoc .-> NAS

  Intake --> Scripts --> Cloud
  NAS --> Legacy --> OnDW

  %% Styling
  classDef problem stroke-dasharray:5 3,stroke:#e5484d,stroke-width:2px;
```

**Key Characteristics**:
- Multiple uncontrolled entry points (SFTP, shared drives, ad-hoc files).
- Different storage environments holding overlapping data.
- Custom logic scattered across scripts that aren’t centrally managed.

### Future State: Governed and Repeatable
```mermaid
flowchart LR
  %% Sources
  subgraph SRC[Sources]
    CRM[(CRM System)]
    EHR[(Clinical App)]
    LIMS[(Lab System)]
    Sheets[(Spreadsheets – controlled intake)]
  end

  %% Ingestion
  subgraph ING[Ingestion]
    CDC[[Managed Connectors]]
    Batch[[Scheduled Batch]]
    Bronze[(Landing / Bronze – Raw)]
  end

  %% Core Environment
  subgraph CORE[Core Environment]
    DQ{{Automated Quality Checks}}
    Transforms[[Versioned Processing]]
    Silver[(Refined / Silver – Cleaned)]
    Gold[(Curated / Gold – Ready for Use)]
  end

  %% Flows
  CRM --> CDC --> Bronze
  EHR --> CDC --> Bronze
  LIMS --> Batch --> Bronze
  Sheets -. template/validation .-> Bronze

  Bronze --> DQ --> Transforms --> Silver --> Transforms --> Gold

```

**Key Characteristics**:
- One governed front door for all sources.
- Automated checks ensure issues are caught before they spread.
- Layered structure (Raw → Refined → Curated) for clarity and trust.
- Repeatable processing patterns replace scattered, one-off scripts.

## From –> To: What Changed and Why

The table below explains each major change from the current state to the governed, repeatable pipelines in the future state. It includes plain-language descriptions and examples so the improvements are easier to understand.

| **Current State** (Removed/Changed) | **Future State** (Added/Standardized) | **Future State Examples** | **What it is** | **Why it’s better** |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| SFTP drops from vendors | Managed connectors / change feeds | Salesforce connector, HL7 feed, Snowflake Data Share | Direct, governed integrations that pull or stream data automatically from source systems | Reduces manual steps, ensures timeliness, and eliminates missed/duplicated files |
| API pulls (custom scripts) | Managed connectors | FHIR API, REST API connector | Built-in, monitored connections to source APIs | No need for one-off scripts; easier to maintain and scale |
| Shared drive intake (NAS) | Controlled intake (templates, validation) | Secure upload portal, governed S3 bucket | Standard process for uploading data with built-in checks | Prevents uncontrolled or incomplete data from entering the environment |
| Legacy jobs | Versioned processing | dbt, SQL scripts in Git | Processing logic stored in code with version control | Increases reproducibility, auditability, and collaboration |
| Ad-hoc scripts | Standardized transforms | dbt models, reusable SQL macros | Reusable, documented transformation logic | Reduces risk of inconsistencies between teams |
| On-prem DW as “truth” | Single analytical store | Snowflake, Databricks, Redshift | One authoritative store for curated data | Avoids “two sources of truth” and speeds decision-making |
| No early quality checks | Automated quality checks (DQ) | Great Expectations, dbt tests | Rules and tests applied when data first enters | Catches errors early before they spread |
| No layered storage | Bronze / Silver / Gold layers | Bronze (raw files), Silver (cleaned tables), Gold (business-ready views) | Raw (Bronze), refined (Silver), curated (Gold) stages | Clear separation of data states; improves lineage and trust |

## Why This Matters

This isn’t about chasing the latest software. It’s about setting up an engineering approach that:

- Handles growth without adding chaos.  
- Makes processes repeatable across teams and projects.  
- Gives you a single, trusted foundation for all downstream work.  

When your data environment is designed this way, technology choices become easier, because they’re guided by a clear operating model instead of being the starting point.

---

## Next Steps

If your current-state looks more like the first diagram than the second, the first move isn’t to buy new software. It’s to map your flows, identify the uncontrolled entry points, and decide what your “front door” should be.

From there, governance, automation, and layered structure follow naturally — and the result is an environment that supports the work you’re doing today and the scale you’ll need tomorrow.

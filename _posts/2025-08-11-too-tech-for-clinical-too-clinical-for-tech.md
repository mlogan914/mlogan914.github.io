  Bridging the Gap Between Innovation and Regulation

I work in a strange in-between place. On one side: the highly regulated, cautiously paced world of clinical research — pharmaceuticals, medical devices, health organizations — where systems like Electronic Data Capture (EDC) keep trials running and regulators happy.

On the other side: modern tech engineering — cloud platforms, automation, DevOps, platform engineering — where the expectation is rapid iteration, frequent deployment, and “if it’s not automated by next week, what are we even doing?”

Somehow, I’m *too tech for clinical* and *too clinical for tech*. And it’s… a little like being bilingual in two dialects that don’t think they need translators.

## The Clinical Side: “We Could Innovate… But Why Rush?”
The clinical research world isn’t opposed to innovation — it’s just heavily optimized for stability and compliance. Change is slow because:  
- Every new system must be validated.  
- Every process must meet regulatory expectations.  
- The stakes aren’t just uptime and user retention; they’re patient safety and data integrity.  

These are valid reasons. But they also mean that a lot of innovation falls into the “someday, maybe” pile. If your system still works and still passes audits, the incentive to replace it is often very low.

## The Tech Side: “We Can Totally Rebuild This By Friday”
Modern engineers can design platforms in days that would take years to approve in clinical research. They see slow-moving processes and think, *“This just needs better tooling.”*

Except… it’s not just tooling. It’s also regulation, legacy interoperability, domain-specific standards, and workflows designed to satisfy auditors and sponsors — not just end users.

When a tech team looks at clinical systems, they often underestimate:  
- The constraints that are non-negotiable.  
- The rules that can’t be “optimized away.”  
- The hidden complexity that’s invisible until you try to change it.

## Why the Middle Matters
Working in this middle space means understanding two very different sets of priorities — and being able to explain them to each other without either side glazing over.

It’s about:  
- Translating *“this is how it’s always been done”* into *“here’s how it could work better — without breaking the rules.”*  
- Showing fast-moving engineers that not all obstacles are “technical debt” — some are guardrails that exist for a reason.  
- Finding solutions that feel like progress to both sides, even if they define progress differently.  

Without people in this role, projects either stall in endless debates or crash into reality halfway through. The bridge in the middle is what keeps forward motion possible.

## The Part No One Talks About

Being in the middle often feels like speaking into the void.  

The clinical side has the power to change but not the will — their incentives are tied to compliance, not transformation. The engineering side has the skills to change things but not the desire — the complexity is too messy, the regulations too restrictive, and the work too far removed from what they know.  

That leaves a very small group of people — people like me — who *both* understand the potential and *care enough* to try.  

It’s a strange kind of isolation. You can see the path forward, but most of the audience you’re trying to reach is either uninterested, overwhelmed, or incentivized to keep things exactly as they are. And yet… if you don’t try to bridge the gap, nothing changes at all.

## The Real Challenge — And Opportunity
This middle space can be frustrating, but it’s also where the most meaningful change happens. Progress here isn’t about grand overhauls — it’s about finding small, strategic shifts that work for *both* sides.

It’s where you can:  
- Spot opportunities to simplify without oversimplifying.  
- Introduce improvements in a way that feels safe to adopt.  
- Build trust so that when bigger changes are needed, teams are ready for them.  

It’s not about moving fast — it’s about moving smart, earning buy-in, and fixing the right things.

If you’re in this space too, you know the tension — and the silence. But you also know that the people who can bridge these worlds are rare, and necessary.  

We may be few, but we’re the ones who show what’s possible. And if you ask me, that’s what being *too tech for clinical and too clinical for tech* is all about.

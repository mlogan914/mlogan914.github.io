## Why teams call me
Many organizations — from complex regulated environments to fast-moving startups — are overwhelmed by data coming from too many places:
- Different systems and vendors
- Spreadsheets from multiple teams
- Numbers that don’t match depending on where they’re pulled

They know there’s a problem, but they don’t know:
- What data they actually have  
- Where it’s coming from  
- How it connects (or doesn’t)  
- Which issues to fix first (and why)  

**Without clarity, teams lose time, duplicate effort, and base decisions on unreliable information.**

---

## What you get
A short, fixed-scope **advisory engagement (2–3 weeks)** that delivers:

1. **Current-State Data Map** — Clear visual of sources, systems, and handoffs *(Illustrative example available — not based on any current or past client work)*  
2. **Issue & Risk Report** — Where delays, duplication, and errors occur  
3. **Prioritized “Top 5”** — What to address first for maximum impact  
4. **Future-State Blueprint** — A high-level concept for a cleaner, more usable data flow

## Who it’s for
You’ll get the most value if you:
- Feel overwhelmed by the amount or complexity of your data  
- Aren’t sure how data really moves between people and systems  
- Want a clear, unbiased view **before** buying tools or hiring more staff  

This audit is especially valuable for:
- Teams in complex, highly regulated environments (e.g., healthcare, manufacturing, technology)  
- Organizations with cross-team data flows spanning multiple systems, vendors, or locations  

---

## Who it’s not for
- Teams looking solely for a software purchase recommendation  
- Organizations expecting hands-on implementation as part of the initial engagement  

---

## Outcomes (examples)
- Reduced duplicate reporting work by **40%**, saving dozens of staff hours each month  
- Shortened decision-making cycles from weeks to days  
- Identified bottlenecks delaying project milestones by **3+ months**  
- Uncovered hidden dependencies that risked compliance deadlines  

---

## Why work with me
I’ve been on both sides — hands-on in the data trenches and designing the systems to make that work scalable. That means you get practical recommendations you can actually implement, not a binder of theory.  

---

## Why it works
- **No tech overhaul** — This is advisory, not an implementation project  
- **Approachable & visual** — Plain-language explanations and diagrams anyone can follow  
- **Actionable** — You walk away with a prioritized plan, not a vague wishlist

## About me
I’m **Melanie Logan** — a Data Platform Engineer (and former Statistical Programmer).  

I help teams cut through data chaos by uncovering how their data truly moves across systems, then guiding them toward smarter, more scalable decisions. My experience spans both highly regulated environments and fast-paced industries, giving me the ability to adapt recommendations to your specific context.

  <summary><strong>FAQ</strong></summary>

  <div markdown="1">

**Is this only for regulated teams?**  
No — while I have deep regulated experience, this audit benefits any team with complex, multi-source data flows.

**Will you implement the recommendations?**  
Implementation is outside this audit’s scope. If helpful, I can support vendor/tool selection or light oversight as a separate engagement.

**Do we need to share sensitive data?**  
No raw data access is required. We focus on flows, systems, handoffs, and existing outputs.

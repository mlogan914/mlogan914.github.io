# Data Clarity Audit
**Get a clear picture of your data landscape before you make your next move.**

## Why teams call me
Many teams—pharma, biotech, med device, and beyond—are drowning in data coming from too many places:
- Different systems and vendors.
- Spreadsheets from multiple teams.
- Numbers that don’t match depending on where they’re pulled.

They know there’s a problem, but they don’t know:
- What data they actually have.
- Where it’s coming from.
- How it connects (or doesn’t).
- Which issues to fix first (and why).

---

## What you get
A short, fixed-scope **advisory engagement (2–3 weeks)** that delivers:

1. **Current-State Data Map** — Clear architecture diagram of sources, systems, and handoffs.  
2. **Issue & Risk Report** — Where delays, duplication, and errors occur.  
3. **Prioritized “Top 5”** — What to fix first for maximum impact.  
4. **Future-State Blueprint** — A high-level concept for a cleaner, more usable data flow.

## Engagement at a glance
| Item | Details |
|---|---|
| Duration | 2–3 weeks |
| Format | 3–4 working sessions + remote analysis |
| Deliverables | PDF report, visual data map, prioritized improvement plan |
| Commitment | Fixed-scope, fixed-fee advisory (no implementation required) |

---

## Who it’s for
You’ll get the most value if you:
- Feel overwhelmed by the amount/complexity of your data.
- Aren’t sure how data really moves between people and systems.
- Want a clear, unbiased view **before** buying tools or hiring more staff.

---

## Outcomes (examples)
- Identified **40% duplicate effort** in weekly reporting and removed it.
- Uncovered hidden dependencies delaying key milestones.
- Gave leadership a clear focus for **highest-ROI** fixes.

---

## Why it works
- **No tech overhaul** — This is advisory, not an implementation project.  
- **Approachable & visual** — Plain-language explanations and diagrams anyone can follow.  
- **Actionable** — You walk away with a prioritized plan, not a vague wishlist.

  <summary><strong>FAQ</strong></summary>

  <div markdown="1">

**Is this only for regulated teams?**  
No. While I have deep regulated experience, this audit benefits any team with data scattered across systems.

**Will you implement the recommendations?**  
Implementation is outside this audit’s scope. If helpful, I can support vendor/tool selection or light oversight as a separate engagement.

**Do we need to share sensitive data?**  
No raw data access is required for the audit. We focus on flows, systems, handoffs, and existing outputs.

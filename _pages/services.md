<div class="notice--info">
  See exactly how your data moves — and where it’s getting stuck — before you make your next move.

<div class="notice--info" markdown="1">
  **Note:** This is a pilot version of Data Clarity Audit, designed to be a focused, high-impact engagement. I’m currently offering it to a small number of organizations as I refine the process. If you’re interested in being part of the pilot or discussing future availability, feel free to get in touch.

## Why Teams Call Me
In many organizations, data is scattered across systems, teams, and vendors. You might feel like you spend more time moving data around than actually using it.

**Common signs:**
- **Conflicting reports or metrics** — the same question gets different answers depending on who you ask  
- **Slow handoffs and rework** between teams/vendors  
- **Manual reconciliations** and “spreadsheet glue” holding critical processes together  
- **Unclear ownership** and “hidden” upstream dependencies that break things unexpectedly  

**Most often, I see this in:**
- Healthcare, life sciences, and other regulated industries where processes are high-stakes but fragmented  
- Distributed teams with multiple vendors or complex reporting requirements  
- Fast-moving organizations where every team adds tools without a central plan

**Leaders know there’s a problem — but not**:
- What data they actually have  
- Where it’s coming from  
- How it flows (or fails to flow) between people and systems  
- Which fixes will matter most  

Without this clarity, teams waste time, duplicate work, and make decisions on unreliable information.  
That’s where I come in — giving you a clear picture of your data and where to focus first.

## What You Get
A short, focused **advisory engagement (2–3 weeks)** designed to give you clarity fast.  

By the end, you’ll have a **complete picture of your current data reality** and a **clear path to the biggest improvements**.

**1 - Current-State Data Map** — A clear, visual diagram of your systems, data sources, and handoffs so everyone sees the same picture.

```

**2 - Issues & Risks Report** — Identifies where delays, duplication, and errors occur, explains why they happen, and highlights the cost of leaving them unresolved.

**3 - Prioritized “Top 5”** — A short list of the changes that will deliver the fastest and biggest impact, so you know exactly where to start.

**4 - Future-State Blueprint** — A high-level target flow for cleaner, more reliable data operations.

## Engagement at A Glance

| Item | Details |
|---|---|
| Duration | 2–3 weeks |
| Format | 3–4 working sessions + remote analysis |
| Deliverables | PDF report, visual data map, prioritized improvement plan |
| Commitment | Fixed-scope, fixed-fee advisory (no implementation required) |

---

## Who It’s For
Best fit for teams that:
- **Feel overwhelmed** by the complexity or volume of their data  
- **Aren’t sure** how data really moves between people, systems, and vendors  
- **Want clarity first** — before investing in new tools or hiring more staff  
- Need a **fast, low-risk way** to identify their biggest opportunities

Especially valuable for:
- Healthcare, life sciences, and other highly regulated environments  
- Organizations with distributed teams, multiple vendors, or complex reporting requirements  

---

## Who It’s Not For
Not a fit if you’re only:
- Looking for a single tool/software recommendation  
- Expecting hands-on implementation during this short engagement  

*(If implementation is needed, we can scope it separately.)*

---

## How It Helps
- **Faster, more confident decisions** — Fix upstream disconnects so reports align the first time  
- **Less waste** — Eliminate redundant processes and manual reconciliations  
- **Stronger foundations** — Make smarter choices about systems, vendors, and staffing  
- **Clear priorities** — Focus on changes that deliver the biggest impact quickly  

---

## Why It Works
- **Independent view** — No vendor bias or software upsell  
- **Approachable & visual** — Clear diagrams and explanations anyone can follow  
- **Actionable** — You leave with a prioritized plan you can start using right away, not a vague wishlist

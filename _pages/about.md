I’m Melanie Logan — a platform engineer designing **internal platforms for data** in high-stakes environments.  

My focus: making complex workflows reproducible, automatable, and future-ready — showing teams not just what’s required, but what’s *possible*.

My work isn’t automation for automation’s sake. It’s **reimagining the architecture** behind how data is defined, transformed, and delivered — especially in regulated environments that have historically deprioritized reuse, transparency, and modern engineering.

I began my career in statistical programming, working hands-on with clinical trial data and regulatory deliverables. What I saw was this: most teams weren’t working *with* systems — they were working *around* them. Manually. Repeatedly. Invisibly.

So I started building something different.

### ⧉ What I’m Building

I call it **Blueprint-as-a-Service (BaaS)** — a metadata-driven platform that turns models like CDISC ODM-XML into **actual, working pipelines** for SDTM transformation.

**Under the hood:**  
- Python, dbt, Jinja, SQL  
- GitHub Actions for reproducibility  
- Metadata as infrastructure, not just documentation

But the deeper goal is this:  
To **model a better way** — proving it’s possible to modernize even the most rigid workflows *without abandoning the standards that matter*.

### ∴ Why It Matters

I don’t expect an overnight industry shift.  
But I do believe someone needs to **show what’s possible**.

Because if we keep designing for the past, we’ll never be ready for what’s next — real-time submissions, AI-assistive pipelines, or simply teams who deserve better tooling.

This work is my contribution to that future:  
A proof-of-concept for what regulated data infrastructure *could* be — if we let it grow.

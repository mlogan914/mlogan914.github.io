## About Me

I’m **Melanie Logan** — a data platform engineer building systems for clinical research that reflect not just what’s required, but what’s *possible*.  

I began my career in **statistical programming for clinical trials**, working with compliance-heavy datasets. Over time, I saw the same pattern: teams working *around* their systems instead of with them — manually, repeatedly, and often invisibly.  

Now, I focus on **modernizing regulated data ecosystems** by combining:  
- **Deep domain expertise** in clinical research standards  
- **Platform engineering principles** like modular architecture, CI/CD, and self-service patterns  
- **Metadata-driven automation** that adapts instead of breaking  

One of my core projects, **Blueprint-as-a-Service (BaaS)**, turns CDISC ODM-XML metadata into working SDTM pipelines using Python, dbt, Jinja, and SQL — treating **metadata as infrastructure**, not just documentation. The goal isn’t speed for speed’s sake, but to design pipelines that are **resilient, transparent, and able to evolve**.

### ⧉ What You’ll Find Here
- **Project updates** on BaaS and other metadata-driven frameworks.  
- **Industry perspectives** on bridging legacy workflows with modern engineering.  
- **Practical insights** for designing high-stakes pipelines that meet compliance while staying adaptable.  

If you’ve ever heard *“it’s always been done this way”* and wanted to prove there’s a better path — you’re in the right place.

### ∴ Why It Matters

I don’t expect an overnight industry shift,  but I do believe someone needs to **show what’s possible**.

Because if we keep designing for the past, we’ll never be ready for what’s next — whether that’s real-time submissions, intelligent automation, or simply teams who deserve better tooling.

This work is my contribution to that future:  

A proof-of-concept for what regulated data infrastructure *could* be — if we let it grow.

If this resonates — or if you’re building something similar in another corner of the world — I’d love to connect and share ideas.

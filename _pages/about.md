## About Me

I’m **Melanie Logan**, a Data Platform Engineer and former Statistical Programmer with experience modernizing how complex, regulated data is defined, transformed, and delivered.

I help organizations move from manual, siloed processes to reusable, metadata-driven data systems with quality and traceability built in from the start.

Over the years, I’ve developed a reputation for:
- **Deep domain understanding** of regulated data environments  
- **Modern engineering mindset** grounded in platform engineering, data engineering, and DevOps  
- **System design expertise** for scalable, compliance-ready infrastructure  
- **End-to-end perspective** across the full data lifecycle, from raw inputs to standardized outputs  

I apply modern engineering principles in environments where governance and quality aren’t optional, building systems teams can trust and sustain.

### ⧉ What You’ll Find Here
- **Project updates** on blueprint-style and metadata-driven frameworks  
- **Industry perspectives** on bridging legacy workflows with modern engineering  
- **Practical insights** for designing high-stakes data pipelines that remain compliant and adaptable  

If you’ve ever heard *“it’s always been done this way”* and wanted to prove there’s a better path — you’re in the right place.

### ∴ Why It Matters

I don’t expect the industry to change overnight — but I do believe someone needs to **show what’s possible**.

Designing for the past leaves us unprepared for what’s next

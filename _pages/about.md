I’m Melanie Logan — a data platform engineer building systems for clinical research that reflect not just what’s required, but what’s *possible*.

My work isn’t about automation for the sake of speed. It’s about **reimagining the architecture** that underpins how clinical data is defined, transformed, and delivered — especially in regulated environments that have historically deprioritized reuse, transparency, and modern engineering.

I began my career in statistical programming, working hands-on with clinical trial data and regulatory deliverables. What I saw was this: most teams weren’t working with systems — they were working around them. Manually. Repeatedly. Silently.

So I started building something different.

### ⧉ What I’m Building

I call it **Blueprint-as-a-Service (BaaS)** — a framework for turning metadata (like CDISC ODM-XML) into **actual, working pipelines** for SDTM transformation.

Under the hood, it uses:
- Python, dbt, Jinja, SQL
- GitHub Actions for reproducibility
- CDISC metadata as infrastructure, not just documentation

But the deeper goal is this:  
To **model a better way**, and to prove that it's possible to modernize clinical data workflows *without abandoning the standards that matter*.

### ∴ Why It Matters

I don’t expect the industry to adopt this tomorrow.  
But I do believe someone needs to **show what’s possible**.

Because if we keep designing workflows for the past, we’ll never be ready for what’s next — whether it’s real-time submissions, AI-assistive pipelines, or simply teams who deserve better tooling.

This work is my contribution to that future.  
A proof-of-concept for what clinical data infrastructure *could* be — if we let it grow.
